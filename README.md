Learning Rust by writing a musical synthesizer

Thanks for looking! This is a hobby project written in spare time. My aims are to

* Learn more about the Rust programming language
* Learn more about digital signal processing
* Practice maintaining and refactoring a codebase

Code is an everlasting work in progress :)
